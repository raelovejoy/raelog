  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="sub">A logbook. A trace. A place to leave markers.</p>
</header>

<p>
  <strong>Raelog</strong> is where I put observations and field notes—unfinished thinking that I want to be able to find again.
</p>

<h2><strong>What you’ll find</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>notes on technology, power, systems, and culture</li>
  <li>project logs and “what I’m building / learning” trails</li>
  <li>writing fragments that might later become something else</li>
  <li>occasional documentation of experiments, tools, and workflows</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How this works</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>entries are chronological</li>
  <li>conclusions are optional</li>
  <li>contradictions are allowed</li>
  <li>this is primarily for future-me, but it’s public</li>
</ul>
