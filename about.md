<p>
  <strong>Raelog</strong> is a personal field 'log' maintained by
  <a href="https://raelovejoy.com">Rae Lovejoy</a><a href="https://raearea.net/name.txt">*</a>.
</p>

<h2><strong>What this is</strong></h2>
<p>
  It isn't a 'blog' in the 'normal' sense. It's more like a place to jot things down
  so they don’t disappear — observations, half-formed ideas, project notes, 
  questions, thought experiments, philosophy, and patterns noticed over time. 
  A virtual 'field' log. 
</p>

<h2><strong>What you’ll find</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>notes on technology, systems, power, and culture</li>
  <li>project logs and 'what I'm building / learning' trails</li>
  <li>writing fragments that might later turn into something else</li>
  <li>documentation of tools, experiments, or workflows when it's useful</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How this works</strong></h2>
<p class="dim">
  This is intentionally closer to a 'field log' than a blog: observations over arguments,
  context over completeness, fragments over conclusions.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>entries are chronological</li>
  <li>posts are occasionally polished ('living' posts)</li>
  <li>conclusions are optional</li>
  <li>contradictions are allowed</li>
  <li>this is mostly for future-me, maybe some people I know, but it's public anyway</li>
</ul>
