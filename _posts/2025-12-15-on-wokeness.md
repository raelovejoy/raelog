title: "On wokeness"
summary: why helping people threatens entrenched power
---

"Woke" doesn’t mean "progressive." "Woke" really means anything that weakens hierarchy.

That is why [fonts](https://www.fastcompany.com/91458062/brief-history-of-calibri-the-woke-font-trump-is-replacing), accessibility, plain language, empathy, and accurate history get attacked. Helping people is not treated as neutral, but 'dangerous.'

The systems being defended are stacked:

- Religion → moral authority without consent  
- Patriarchy → control of bodies and care labor  
- Race → inequality framed as "natural"  
- Capitalism → human value reduced to productivity  

These systems reinforce each other. When one is threatened, all of them feel it.

Accessibility becomes a flashpoint because it does something fundamentally disruptive:

- it makes systems legible  
- it reduces gatekeeping  
- it lowers dependence on authority  

Accessibility says: "You don’t need permission to understand." 
That is inherently anti-authoritarian.

So help gets rebranded as:

"woke"  
"degenerate"  
"communist"  
"lazy"  
"feminine"  
"gay"  

When people are helped, a few things happen that are dangerous from the perspective of power:

- people become less dependent on authority  
- systems that once confused them become understandable  
- survival requires less permission  
- people start asking why things are structured the way they are  

That threatens hierarchies built on dependency, confusion, shame, and scarcity.

Help becomes weakness.  
Accessibility becomes indulgence.  
Empathy becomes corruption.  
Understanding becomes "indoctrination."

If helping people were framed honestly, the question would be:
"Why didn’t we do this sooner?"

So instead it is reframed as:
"This helps the wrong people."

This is why help gets gendered, sexualized, racialized, and politicized. It is not about outcomes. It is about who is allowed ease, dignity, and understanding—and who is not.

Calling help "woke" is a way of saying:
Suffering is part of the system. Do not touch it.

Fascism does not arrive in uniforms.  
It arrives saying:

- "This is just common sense"  
- "We’re protecting order"  
- "You’re overreacting"  

It modernizes, and it denies its own name.

A useful tell:

If a system fears
- plain language  
- accessibility  
- accurate history  
- reduced suffering  

the ***"problem"*** is not "wokeness."

The ***"problem"*** is power losing its grip.
