title: "On universal coherence"
summary: a working lens for patterns across systems
---

I will often use the phrase **"universal coherence"** across this site, and outside of it, so I might as well introduce it.

"Universal coherence" is not a belief system, ideology, or finished theory. It is a **working model** I use to reason about systems—technical, social, biological, and cognitive—without reducing everything to productivity, optimization, or control.

### The short version

- Systems tend toward coherence or incoherence over time.
- Coherence is not uniformity or efficiency—it is **mutual compatibility**.
- Breakdown usually happens at boundaries: feedback loops, mismatched scales, or forced participation.
- What we call "progress" often increases local coherence while degrading global coherence.

That lens has proven useful to me when thinking about technology, labor, power, and participation.

### What I mean by coherence

By *coherence*, I mean a condition where parts of a system:
- can interact without constant friction,
- do not require coercion to remain stable,
- and maintain adaptability under stress.

This applies just as much to software and networks as it does to institutions, cultures, or physical bodies.

Coherence is not 'moral' by default. A system can be internally coherent and still harmful (false—or forced—coherence). The question is **coherent for whom, and at what cost**.

### Why I use this lens

Many dominant frameworks reduce complex systems to:
- efficiency metrics,
- growth curves,
- incentives and outputs.

Those abstractions often erase lived experience, externalized harm, and long-term instability.

Coherence gives me a way to talk about:
- why systems feel "off" before they visibly fail,
- why participation under coercion degrades trust,
- and why optimization frequently destroys resilience.

### Relationship to my other work

Universal coherence is explored more formally in a separate project, which lives outside Raelog:

- Project home: [https://dev11.systems/ucf](https://dev11.systems/ucf)  
- Repository: [https://github.com/dev11systems/universal-coherence-framework](https://github.com/dev11systems/universal-coherence-framework)

Raelog is not documentation for that project. Raelog is where I **apply the lens informally** while thinking in public.

You do not need to read the project material to follow posts here. When coherence shows up, this note is the context.

### Status

This model is unfinished and evolving. I expect to revise it as I encounter better explanations or discover where it fails.
