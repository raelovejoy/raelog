## Original title: On Life, the World, and Society
***Published February 14, 2008***

> **Present-day note (2025):**  
> This post was originally written in 2008 and is preserved largely as-is, as a snapshot of my thinking at the time. It reflects an early attempt to grapple with humanity’s relationship to nature, society, and itself. While my language and framing have evolved since then, many of the underlying concerns remain familiar.

Sometimes I think we, as human beings, need to take a good step back and simply notice all that we have been missing out on from our hard-pressed lives; lives which are continuously bound by the daily weight of work and stress. As humans, it is absolutely essential to remember to step back every so often and just notice things: the crisp smell of clean air (if you are lucky); the gentle touch of grass; the soft warmth of the sun; the relaxing sound of a forest; the sight of birds flying effortlessly through the air; and the beauty of a sunset.

There is so much that all of us take for granted, but we are so distracted by our nearly robotic lives that we have unfortunately become oblivious of and desensitized to the awe and wonder of the natural world, which is all around us. We constantly fear the unpredictability of weather and its effects on human society. We try to avoid things like rain and snow because it interferes with our ability to carry out our daily lives in comfort, and we panic in really bad weather or during natural disasters—where, for the most part, we are ill-prepared.

Over hundreds of thousands of years, we have almost completely forgotten about our most basic natural abilities—especially our ability to survive in the wild; our ability to adapt to varying situations and environments; our ability to live self-sufficiently with only what we need, without modern tools and technologies; our ability to live in a world without unnecessary medicines by utilizing plants, trees, and other natural resources; and our ability to live in harmony with one another and the natural world.

We should be embracing nature, not ignoring it— not fearing it.

Like it or not, we live in a world that has the ability to harm us, naturally or not. Man-made threats—such as war, overpopulation, waste, pollution, climate change, toxins, resource depletion, habitat destruction, and land degradation—pose significant threats to both humans and wildlife.

We also have the ability to protect ourselves from these things, if we are willing to help ourselves pioneer necessary solutions, and not just technologically, no matter what the cost.

It is our responsibility to take care of what we have affected and infected with our harmful waste and negative habits. Like it or not, we must sacrifice some basic conveniences so we can live efficiently and in harmony with our environment.
