The internet used to make the world feel big.

Not an "endless feed" kind of big, where endless scrolling might as well be life moving fast, and eventually right past you. Like you are *The* benevolant observer looking through a one-way mirror. *The* main charactor of your own fantacy world. A *god* in your own image (literally, you). At first, without any power. Without any way to affect the world. 

And then came the attention economy (and eventually, enshittification). Here came the "influencers." But even they we're just pawns of the men behind the curtains... the tech bro nerds-turned-capitalists-turned-billionaire-fascist parasites. They sucked the life out of those frozen in motion by their rented little glass rectangles. Their black mirrors. Always reminding you of your lonliness and inevitable doom. 

No, the old internet was more like… you could just see farther, and also within. If that makes sense. You’d fall into weird little corners and find people and discover information you that didn’t know existed. You could learn new and different things that hadn’t been sanded or censored or watered down yet. It felt like opening a giant window into the world. It was sunny and also raining goodness. No [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)([s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage)) required. If anything, clouds were a part of the beauty, not a part of the problem (yet... foreshadowing...as vast as the cloud's shadows are endless). 

[Many puns (and general wordplay) intended.]

The internet was a town. It was Wikipedia, Google (when it was 'better'), Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr, Blogger (why did everything end with an "r" lol), Digg, Pownce, FriendFeed, Facebook (when it wasn’t *as* shitty… jk, it was always shitty), Instagram before it got bought and turned into attention slop, YouTube before it became an ad delivery system, and so many smaller "[Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0)" and '[small web](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/)' sites. 

You could feel the potential of it all. Inspiring. Genuine. Kind. Wholesome. Communal. Intimate. Messy. Meaningful. Open-source-y. Liberated. Even more so in the 80s and 90s, from what I’ve read. Well it all lasted for a while, anyway.

Now the internet feels like a giant fucking city, a giant busy fucking city. Traffic jams (server overload), outages, outrage, chaos, crowds, comments, conflict, crime (#notallcrime #piracy), size, density, disarray, distraction, overwhelm, misinformation, propaganda, bullshit, bots, spam, slop, noise, disconnection, etc. etc. etc. It has all the same problems as real cities, just abstracted, accelerated, and piped directly into your nervous system.

There are just... so many people and things and bots online. Everyone is talking all at once, or performing, or optimizing themselves, or fighting for attention because attention is the thing now, not care or understanding. Just attention. And more attention. And infinity attention plus one. (fuck, wait, does this blog count as attention? whoah, meta [...not *that* Meta, *eww*]).

And I don't even think the *now* internet is a moral failure. It's all structural (literally, the internet is a series of... wires... and obviously computers), it's all systemic (the system is a propritary walled-garden OS [or operating system], after all). As usual... always has been. The system rewards being seen, not being decent. Loud vs thoughtful. Fast vs careful. Extremes vs nuance. So of course people hoard attention like "likes" or "subscribe"s... or Bitcoin. That’s how you survive in a place like this. Let's not forget how fucked up that is. 

What still fucks me up is how “connection” got rerouted, hijacked, stolen, sidelined... pick your verb. It was said that the internet would connect us to each other, which at one point it did (pre-2010s). Instead, now, it mostly connected us to platforms, brands, feeds, metrics. Capitalism wearing a fake friendly face while quitely guarding/maintaining the walls it builds between people, reality, and meaning. 

Capitalism couldn't cure loneliness, no, it just got packaged differently and sold back to everyone (again). Like it's a personal flaw instead of the obvious outcome of how things evolved (or more accurately, devolved).

The internet used to make the world feel big because it revealed depth. Now it feels as big—or bigger—than the actual world because it’s all scale and no intimacy. It's big tech but small thinking. It's endless presence (and not *that* kind), but very little being met. It's infinite content, but shallow meaning. Everything got hollowed out.

Of course, this internet, this "world wide web" is not a complete world. It’s definitely not as beautiful as the real one. But it’s dense enough to live inside, hollow enough to fall inside, and lonely enough inside, with enough time. Sometimes more lonely, because you’re surrounded but still feel invisible.

So yeah, I miss the wholesome wide web. When logging on felt like arriving somewhere, not getting lost everywhere.
